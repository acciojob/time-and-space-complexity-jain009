	<h1>Time,Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity is the understood as the time taken to the program  by run and complete given task. your goal should be  optimise the program and redusing time coplexity </p>
 <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. For example, some algorithms may require additional memory proportional to the input size, represented as O(n).
